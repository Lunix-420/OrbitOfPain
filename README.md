# 🚀 Orbit of Pain

You're a lone spacecraft stranded in deep space, caught in the wreckage of a long-forgotten alien war. They're endless, relentless, and powered by the same energy that's keeping you alive.

Your energy is fading. To survive, you’ll need to destroy them and scavenge what's left to keep your systems running. But they’re deadly, and the more you take down, the more will come for you.
